# Conceptual function to determine the optimal node for a transaction
def simulate_execution(transaction_features, historical_node_states):
    """
    Simulates or heuristically determines the optimal execution node
    for a given transaction based on its features and the state of
    available execution nodes at that time.

    Args:
        transaction_features (dict): Features of the transaction.
        historical_node_states (dict): Simulated or actual states of execution nodes
                                     (e.g., queue length, CPU load) at the time of tx.

    Returns:
        int: The ID of the optimal execution node.
